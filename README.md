# Wiz750SR-ZYNQ_RGB_controller
Serial to Ethernet connectity to a ZYNQ FPGA for RGB LED control.

This project uses a Wiz750Sr and a MiniZed FPGA SoC together with a Python Flask 
web-app to allow real time control of a PWM controlled RGB led via a web-browser.

Inport the hdf file on the SDK and use the provided FW to control 
the RGB led connected to pins a0,A1, A2 of the arduino shield.
